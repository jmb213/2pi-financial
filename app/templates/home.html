        <p>
            In planning for retirement, it is difficult to obtain good answers to some of the most important questions.
            How much money must be saved to achieve a desired lifestyle?
            How should investments be divided among safe and risky assets?
            How should this division be adjusted over time as personal circumstances and economic conditions change? 
<br><br>
            For many decades, academics and serious practitioners have advanced our knowledge of investments and asset allocation.
            The benefits of this knowledge are inaccessible to most people -- difficult to understand and challenging to apply.
            2PiFinancial seeks to bridge the gap between knowledge and the ability to utilize that knowledge.
            2PiFinancial provides a set of advanced tools and information that help individuals manage the financial aspects of their lives -- free of charge.

      Individuals who are similar in age, wealth, and earning potential may optimally choose very different portfolios because of differences in their preferences.
      Some individuals may prefer a low-risk portfolio that offers a very high likelihood of a modest lifestyle.
      Others may prefer to target a more lavish lifestyle and accept the risk of falling short of target.
      2PiFinancial can help construct the portfolio that is right for you.
<br><br>
      Financial decisions include not only how to invest for tomorrow but also how to live today.
      Each of us must decide what career to pursue, how much education to obtain, and when to retire.
      These difficult decisions should be considered in light of savings and desired lifestyle.
      While these decisions are personal, 2PiFinancial can help quantify the impact of alternative choices.
      You may choose to drive a more expensive car or live in a larger house but you should understand how these decisions could affect your quality of life in retirement.

            Most financial advisory firms implement 'Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT),' which refers to the path-breaking work of Harry Markowitz and others.
            Their work revolutionized professional investing by carefully defining risk and relating risk to expected returns.
            Markowitz's analysis highlights the importance of diversification and the need to view the risk of a security in terms of its impact on the portfolio rather than the security's stand-alone risk.
<br><br>
            While the ideas underlying MPT are crucial, the theory does not address issues related to investing over many years.
            Harry Markowitz's analysis did not consider how tomorrow may be different from today.
            The world may look riskier tomorrow, or less risky, prompting changes in one's portfolio.
            Importantly, the possibility of changes in the world tomorrow also affects one's portfolio today as one hedges against unfortunate events or prepares to exploit positive developments.
            Consideration of an evolving world has important ripple effects that influence today's actions.
<br><br>
            Since MPT was developed over 50 years ago, there has been much research that challenges and extends the theory.
            Nobel-prize winning economists have documented that asset returns are more predictable over the long-term than the short-term.
            The long-run predictability in asset returns has enormous implications for managing wealth over many years.
<br><br>
            In addition to changes in expected returns, volatility and correlations vary over time.
            2PiFinancial implements not only the ideas in MPT but also more recent research that is relevant for a long-term investing focus.
            A long-term focus is fundamental to the philosophy of 2PiFinancial.
            2PiFinancial's objective is to help you spend, save, and invest so as to get the most enjoyment from your money.

    <h3>IS BUY AND HOLD ALWAYS THE BEST STRATEGY?</h3>

    <div id="market_plot"></div>

    <div>
        <p>
        Most experts agree that timing the market, that is, predicting stock returns over the next day, week, or even year, is very difficult. But Eugene Fama and Robert Shiller, Nobel-prize winning economists, agree that there is significant predictability
        in asset returns over the long term. Their research demonstrates that it is possible to identify times when stock prices are more likely to rise substantially, modestly, or not at all. 2PiFinancial has developed a measure of stock market valuation
        that is based on the research of Fama, Shiller, and others. The graph uses color to identify times when the S&P 500, a broad index of stock prices, should rise significantly (the market is 'cheap'), rise modestly (the market is 'fair'), and rise
        little or fall (the market is 'expensive'). Move the cursor over the graph to see how the market performed over various time frames. The average future 10 year real return was over 6.0% when valuation was 'cheap', just under 3% when valuation
        was 'fair' and slightly negative when valuation was 'expensive.'
